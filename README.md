Play [Dance Dance Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution) with your tongue using a flexible tongue electrode array (FTEA).

This is a simple Arduino firmware for using the [Sapien LLC Cthulhu Shield](https://github.com/SapienLLCdev/Cthulhu) (an open-source flexible tongue electrode array driver) in lieu of a Dance Dance Revolution floor pad.

It is adapted directly from the mouse driver originally written by Joel Moritz Jr, which he released into the public domain.

Whilst the Cthulhu Shield is no longer produced and Sapien LLC appears to be defunct, the schematics are FOSS.

I have personally tested this code with [StepMania 5](https://www.stepmania.com), and it's remarkably and singularly uncomfortable, yet playable.
